Weâ€™re glad to have many excellent musicians who serve us each week. Over the past few years they have written and recorded their own songs to help us, and other churches, sing the good news about Jesus Christ.

We write songs for the church that let the word of Christ dwell richly in hearts and minds. (Colossians 3:16).

You can listen to our latest album on Spotify and Apple Music, download free sheet music and access our training materials.
