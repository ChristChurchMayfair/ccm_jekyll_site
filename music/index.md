Singing is an essential part of our Sunday services.

We care passionately and think deeply about our music. We use songs to help remind ourselves and respond to what God has done.

During our morning service we sing contemporary songs and classic hymns. At the evening service, we enjoy extended times of singing in a more informal setting.
