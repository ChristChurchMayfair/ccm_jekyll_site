Mornings at CCM are an informal, family friendly time with Bible teaching for everyone, whether young or old and both traditional and contemporary worship, 

We enjoy time all together as a church family and then our children gather in age-specific groups to learn about Jesus for themselves.

We look forward to spending time with each other after the service; making new friends and catching up over coffee.
