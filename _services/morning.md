Mornings at CCM are an informal, family friendly time with Bible teaching for everyone, with both traditional and contemporary worship.

We enjoy time all together as a church family and then our children gather in age-specific groups to learn about Jesus for themselves.

We look forward to spending time with each other after the service, making new friends and catching up over coffee. Once a month we enjoy lunch together.
