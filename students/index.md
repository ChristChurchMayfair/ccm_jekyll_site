CCM is home to students from universites and colleges from all over London.

Sundays are our chance to come together and enjoy the broader range of the church family. Many students come to the 6pm service. Here the feeling is relaxed: our aim is to create space to enjoy God as we praise him, pray to him, and above all as we encounter him through relevant and engaging Bible teaching.

Others prefer the 10:15am service for it's mix of people of different ages and stages.

You'd be really welcome at either service!
