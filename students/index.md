Welcome to the student work at CCM! Our church is home to students from universities and colleges all over London and we would love for you to join us.

Sundays are our chance to come together and enjoy the diversity of our church family. Many students come to the 6pm service. Here the feeling is relaxed: our aim is to create space to enjoy God as we praise him, pray to him, and above all as we encounter him through relevant and engaging Bible teaching.

Many students come to the 6pm service, preferring its relaxed, contemporary feel. There is space to enjoy God as we praise him, pray to him and above all as we encounter him through relevant and engaging Bible teaching.
Others prefer the family friendly nature of the 10.15am service.

You'd be really welcome at either service!
