# Responding to Coronavirus

Dear Church Family,

Life is going to look very different for the next few months as our city, country and world respond to the evolving pandemic.  I want to keep repeating three basic truths for us as a church:

1. **There’s no need to be anxious**.  The Lord commands us to “*Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you*.” 1 Peter 5:7.  Anxiety is a burden which the Lord does not want us to carry, intend us to carry or need us to carry.  He is a Father who knows our tendency to worry but desires us to commit all worries to him.  

Corrie Ten Boom once observed "*Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, it empties today of its strength.*" We would be far better spending time praying than worrying!

A trust in our Father will prevent a descent into the selfish hoarding of resources and will also liberate us to serve other people.

2. **There’s no call to be foolish**.  If we fail to make use of information which then leads us to do damage to our "neighbours" then that is not kind or wise.  It is a blessing to live in a time when there is sophisticated scientific understanding and a wonderful healthcare system in this country.  We should be wise in following their advice.  It is biblically right to follow the advice of the governing authorities (Romans 13) and so as a church we will be following closely government guidance on what size of public meetings are appropriate.  

3. **There’s no place to be judgmental**.  Paul tells us that we must "*Accept the one whose faith is weak without quarrelling over disputable matters*."  (Romans 14:1).  There will be a range of opinions on the best approach to meeting up and my Biblical plea is that we accept one another's views without passing judgment.  

Very practically:
* Sunday services will currently continue.
    - We naturally ask you not come if you are displaying any of the symptoms that the government states should lead to self isolation
    - We ask you to wash hands upon arrival or use the hand sanitizers.
    - We will not be putting out pens or Bibles (although the passages are printed).  	
    - We will ask serving teams only to pour drinks & serve food rather than have many people touch pots, flasks etc
    - We ask you to avoid unnecessary contact: elbow bumps are in, hand shaking is out
* Sunday services will temporarily be live streamed from 15th March for those who have self isolated or are unable to make it to church.  Details can be found in Timeout for church family members.
* Midweek Discipleship Groups will continue to meet.  I am conscious that some groups are already planning to do this remotely using Zoom or similar video conferencing facilities.  Again, if you are displaying symptoms, do stay at home and join in via your ‘phone.  

I think that we are all conscious that this situation is going to last for months.  So, even if it may be in unusual ways, let’s not give up on the habit of meeting together.  (Hebs 10:25)
