# Responding to Coronavirus

Dear Church Family,

Life is going to look very different for the next few months as our city, country and world respond to the evolving pandemic.  I want to keep repeating three basic truths for us as a church:

**1. There’s no need to be anxious**.  The Lord commands us to “*Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you*.” 1 Peter 5:7.  Anxiety is a burden which the Lord does not want us to carry, intend us to carry or need us to carry.  He is a Father who knows our tendency to worry but desires us to commit all worries to him.  

Corrie Ten Boom once observed "*Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, it empties today of its strength.*" We would be far better spending time praying than worrying!

A trust in our Father will prevent a descent into the selfish hoarding of resources and will also liberate us to serve other people.

**2.  There’s no call to be foolish**.  If we fail to make use of information which then leads us to do damage to our "neighbours" then that is not kind or wise.  It is a blessing to live in a time when there is sophisticated scientific understanding and a wonderful healthcare system in this country.  We should be wise in following their advice.  It is biblically right to follow the advice of the governing authorities (Romans 13) and so as a church we will be following closely government guidance on what size of public meetings are appropriate.  

**3. There’s no place to be judgmental**.  Paul tells us that we must "*Accept the one whose faith is weak without quarrelling over disputable matters*."  (Romans 14:1).  There will be a range of opinions on the best approach to meeting up and my Biblical plea is that we accept one another's views without passing judgment.
