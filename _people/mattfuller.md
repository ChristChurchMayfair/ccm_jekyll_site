Matt became a Christian during his time at university through the faithful lifestyle and witness of some friends. He met his wife Ceri there, although it took 7 years before he finally ground her down and she agreed to marry him. They are very grateful to God for their son, Nathan.

Before training for ministry, Matt taught history and politics at secondary schools in Birmingham and London. He was on the staff of this church when it was planted in January 2001 and now gets nervous when he has to leave the city centre and venture into the countryside. He still enjoys reading History and Politics books (for fun!), but nothing gives him greater joy than seeing someone come to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.
