Sharon was brought up going to church, but it was only in her first year of work post-university that the Holy Spirit opened her eyes to see that being good wasn’t going to get her into heaven and that it was only possible through the death of the Lord Jesus, which was, and still is, a big relief and great joy.

After working in publishing for seven years, she found herself being administrator of the church where she put her faith in Jesus. She's been on staff at CCM for  a number of years helping with the practical side of church ministry. By God's providence she met a visiting American called Tom at a morning service in 2015 and married him 16 months later. Sharon loves cooking, travelling and reading (and will recommend Dale Ralph Davies & JC Ryle to you if you stand still long enough).
