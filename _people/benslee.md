Ben is thankful for his Christian family, who brought him up to know Jesus as his Lord and Saviour. At the age of 15 - and ever since - God has been teaching Ben a love for Him and His word through patient pastors, parents and peers, for whom Ben is hugely grateful.

God has proven Himself so faithful in Ben's life; through studying music at City University London, his 2-year apprenticeship at Christ Church Beckenham, and in his recent marraige to the lovely Sarah. Ben enjoys sunny walks, pretty places and tasty food. And all things music, of course!
