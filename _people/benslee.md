Ben is thankful for His Christian family, who brought him up to know Jesus as Saviour and Lord from a young age. God has preserved in his memory a conversation with his mum when he was four years old, where he first trusted that Jesus can take our guilt away through His death on the cross.

Ben is thankful too for the youth leaders and pastors who have cared for him growing up, through studying music in London, and since joining the team at CCM in 2014. He and his wife, Sarah, are expecting their first child.
