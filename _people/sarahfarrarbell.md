Sarah cannot remember a time when she has not known the Lord Jesus as someone real and part of family life when growing up, but she does remember aged eight asking her mother if they could pray together to ask Him to be her own Saviour and Lord. A great encouragement and help in getting to know the Lord better was going to Christian holiday parties as a teenager where she was encouraged to learn to rely on God’s word and to see that living with Christ and for His glory is indeed a life with joy and purpose.

Since leaving university many years ago she have been a pastoral assistant in a university church, taught French, and married Charlie, a Maths teacher in a boarding school. They have 3 children (2 sons at university and a daughter in her last year at school). More recently she was working part-time in the Registrar’s office at her husband’s school. She loves her family, would love to have a lovely garden one day! and really enjoys meeting friends for coffee…
