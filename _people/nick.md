Nick grew up in Cambridge city centre as the son of a local vicar. Around the age of 18, he began to realise that God’s love really is better than life itself. While studying at Loughborough University he got a taste for the joy of sharing Jesus with others. Upon leaving university he married Nicole (punching well above his weight), and together they have spent the last 10 years seeking to share Christ in different jobs in Oxford and Plymouth, followed by training for ministry at Oakhill College. 

Nick loves playing Water Polo, watching Rugby, wrestling his sons (Luke and Judah), and pretending to know more about films than he does.
