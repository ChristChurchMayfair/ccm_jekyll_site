Phil grew up in a Christian home and is forever grateful to his parents for teaching him to trust in Jesus from an early age. However, it took him a very long time to learn that obeying God was the best and fullest way to live.

He started working life as a lawyer in the city and was part of the original team that planted CCM back in 2001. Having trained for ministry and then planted a church in Clapham he's delighted to be back! Along the way he married his lovely wife Juliette. Free time is spent walking their dog Milo, enjoying London and trying to keep fit.
