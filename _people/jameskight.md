James was brought up going to church, and is thankful for the many people over many years who taught him about the life, death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. However, it was only at the age of 16 that he turned from trying to earn forgiveness of sins, to trusting that Jesus’ death means that forgiveness can be freely given to undeserving people. Since then, James moved to London, where he studied Chemical Engineering at university, and joined Christ Church Mayfair, whom he serves as an apprentice. He enjoys reading, and playing or watching most sports.
