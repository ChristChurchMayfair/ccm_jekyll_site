James was brought up going to church, and is thankful for the many people who taught him about the life, death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. However, it was only at the age of 16 that he turned from trying to earn forgiveness of sins, to trusting that forgiveness can be freely given to him through Jesus. Since then, James moved to London to study chemical engineering, and joined Christ Church Mayfair where he met his wife Sam. When he has a spare moment he enjoys reading, and playing sport.
