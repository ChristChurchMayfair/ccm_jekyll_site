Ellie grew up in Tunbridge Wells and became a follower of Jesus as a teenager. She is thankful to God for the people who showed her that she could rest in Jesus' finished work for her on the cross.

She spent three years visiting art galleries and South West sheep farms as part of her theology degree, and loved being part of a church family in Exeter. She returned to Kent to work as a secondary school teacher, and then completed a Bible handling training course whilst at her church. She loves cooking, watching films and visiting London's amazing art galleries.
