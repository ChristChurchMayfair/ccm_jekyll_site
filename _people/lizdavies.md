Liz gave her life to the Lord Jesus as a teenager on a Christian summer camp, understanding for the first time that Jesus died in our place and that the resurrection was both convincing and therefore life changing. She is incredibly grateful for the friendship of a number of Christian women who read the Bible with her throughout university and into adult life, helping her to know Godâ€™s love more fully and challenging her to live for Jesus wholeheartedly. 

Liz met her husband Jody at university and has proceeded to follow him around the world, making moving house a hobby. They are incredibly grateful for their children Ethan and Eliza and as a family they enjoy England rugby, Marvel and time spent under canvas. According to Ethan and Eliza, Liz is most likely to make friends with a stranger or loudly embarrass them! Liz has joined the staff in the short term as a project coordinator to support the administrative staff.
