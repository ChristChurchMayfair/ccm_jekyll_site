Ali managed to navigate her way through school and university life totally unaware of the claims of Christ. It wasn’t until she was working for a firm of Chartered Surveyors (in the marketing department) that she was challenged by a colleague who talked about going to church and being a Christian. A few visits to a church in Wimbledon made her realise that Christians had something, and knew someone, she didn’t.

In God’s perfect timing, 5 days before she set off on a round-the-world trip she went to a church in Nottingham and experienced a life-changing event.  As Psalm 51 was read she was convicted of her sin, then embraced by the love of God and overwhelmed by joy.  She is thrilled to be back in London admin-ing for CCM and involved with Midweek in Mayfair. She loves spending time with her 3 post-school children, when they’re around!
