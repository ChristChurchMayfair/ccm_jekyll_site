Loz flirted a bit with Christianity at senior school (13-18) and even called himself a Christian whilst going to the school Christian meetings and Christian summer camps. However by the end of school he decided it was all bunkum and that he’d heard enough and had enough. Thankfully God wasn’t done with Loz though and a friend from a summer camp invited Loz along to Christ Church Mayfair in late 2005. This opened a floodgate of questions from Loz (which have slowed down but not abated) and after hearing about Jesus over a hundred times it eventually culminated in Loz following Jesus sometime in 2006. Alongside loving Jesus, Loz loves playing rugby (injuries, time and cuddliness permitting) and eating his Mum’s cooking. He also seems to have accidentally started a hat collection. Contributions welcome.
