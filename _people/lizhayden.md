University was a significant turning point in Liz’s life; although she’d grown up going to church it was through meeting the Christian Union at the Glasgow School of Art that she discovered the fullness of life Jesus brings. Liz graduated and moved to London, joining the Christ Church family in 2011. She left London a year later to experience life in the much more hectic city of Beijing.

On her return to the UK she spent five years working with university Christian Unions in southwest London, helping students to live and speak for Jesus. Liz joined the church staff team in 2016 and co-ordinates the women’s ministry, particularly amongst the evening congregation. Liz has been reliably informed she has a distinctive, but infectious, laugh.
