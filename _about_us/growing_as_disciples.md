Jesus’ fundamental command is to “*go and make disciples of all nations*” (Matt 28:19). At CCM we take this command seriously.

We don't want to learn for the sake of knowledge to gather simply for our pleasure.

We want to be disciples every day of the week who worship in Spirit and truth, with both head and heart, with both emotions and thought.
