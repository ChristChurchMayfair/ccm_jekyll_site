Jesus’ commands us to “go and make disciples of all nations” (Matt 28:19) At CCM we take Jesus’ commands seriously so equipping others to follow Jesus is really important.

We don’t want to learn about Jesus for the sake of knowledge or gather information just for our pleasure. In the Bible Jesus talks about his people worshipping in Spirit and truth (John 4:23), that is with both head and heart, with both our emotions and our thoughts.
