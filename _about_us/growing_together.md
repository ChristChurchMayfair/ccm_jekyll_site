Real relationships really matter to us at CCM. Spending time together in small groups helps us build meaningful friendships and grow in our faith. This is where we get to explore the Bible together and work out what it means to live for Jesus. It’s a place to be honest about our lives and pray together because we know we need God’s help. 

Even if you’re just with us for a short time we’d really encourage you to join one.
