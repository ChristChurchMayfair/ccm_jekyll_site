Spending time together as a church family is a great way to encourage each other to love Jesus more. We want to build friendships with one another and help each other to live life right. We want to pray together and share each otherâ€™s worries and concerns. We want to work hard together, to help and encourage one another to serve Jesus in every area of life.
