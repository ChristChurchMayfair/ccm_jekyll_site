We are a central London church and want our church family to reflect the diversity and cultural vibrancy of the city of which we are a part. We want to truly welcome all people and work hard to provide all that is needed for you to belong within our church family. We also want to care for our community both in telling people about Jesus but also in practical ways just as Jesus would have done.
