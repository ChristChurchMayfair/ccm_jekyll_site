In Matthew’s Gospel Jesus tells us to “go and make disciples of all nations” (28:19).

At CCM we take this command seriously. We understand that there are many people in London who will never hear about Jesus unless we go out and tell them. As a church we actively look for ways to share Jesus with people around us, wherever we are.

We also love that London has a real mix of people from different countries and cultures, and we want our church family to reflect this diversity. We therefore strive to be a church that welcomes all people.
