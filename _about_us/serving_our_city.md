We understand that there are many people in London who would never hear about Jesus unless we go out and tell them.

As a church we actively look for ways to share Jesus with people around us, wherever we are.  That could be our workplace, our friends, our courses or it might be alongside the homeless projects or Tamar ministry to trafficked women, that weâ€™re involved in.
