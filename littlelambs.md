Little Lambs is our midweek haven for pre school children and their caregivers. The toddler group runs from 10.00-11.30 every Thursday morning during term time and meets in the CCM church building. We provide a safe environment for your children, with time to play, to sing together and share in story telling each week. We also want to look after parents and care givers and offer the friendship, community and all important coffee and cake we know you need!
Please do pop in and join us, no booking required. We very much look forward canâ€™t wait to welcome you.

Little Lambs will start again on Thursday September 6th 2018.
