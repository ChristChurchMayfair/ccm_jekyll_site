We really encourage the children of our church family to get to know Jesus for themselves. We run a number of age-specific sunday school groups for children aged 2-11 during the 10:15am service. These are led by a team of trained volunteers who are part of the church family. We make every effort to teach the wonderful message of Jesus in an engaging way. Singing, games, activities, and crafts help to communicate the Bible message clearly. Visitors are warmly welcome.
