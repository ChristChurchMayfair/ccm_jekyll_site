We really encourage our children to get to know Jesus for themselves. We run age-specific sunday school groups for children aged 2-11 during the morning service. Our team of trained church family volunteers make every effort to teach the wonderful message of Jesus in an engaging way. Typically a session would include singing, games, activities, and crafts to help communicate the Bible message clearly. We also run a supervised creche for little ones under 2 years of age. 

If you’re visiting, you’d be really welcome to join us!
