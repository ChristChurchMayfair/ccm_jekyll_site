We love to welcome children of any age into our children's groups. They run during the 10:15am service, and are led by a team of trained volunteers who are part of the church family. We aim to teach the wonderful message of Jesus in an engaging and age-appropriate way. Singing, games, activities, and crafts help to reinforce the message. All children are welcome!
