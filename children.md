We really encourage our children to get to know Jesus for themselves. We run age-specific sunday school groups for children aged 2-11 during the morning service. These are led by a team of trained volunteers from our church family who make every effort to teach the wonderful message of Jesus in an engaging way. Singing, games, activities, and crafts help to communicate the Bible message clearly. We used to visitors so if you're only here for one weekend you'd be really welcome.
