Students meet every Tuesday evening to hear a talk, enjoy a cooked meal, and then study the Bible in small groups.

This is where deep friendships are made and church begins to feel like a family.

Whether you are wanting to find out about Jesus for the first time or you're already keen to join a church family, we would love to welcome you.
