Every Tuesday we meet for SKG (Students' Knowing God). Each week there's a talk, a cooked meal, and then we study the Bible in small groups.

This is where deep friendships are made and church begins to feel like a family.

Whether you want to find out about Jesus for the first time or you're already keen to join a church that will help you live for him through your time studying, we would love to welcome you into our church family.
