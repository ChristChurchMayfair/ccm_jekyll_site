The Deacon’s Fund has been set up to care for financial needs of members of the church family experiencing hardship.


The term “Deacon” comes from the start of Acts 6, when a group of believers was chosen to distribute food to widows in the church family, so that the apostles could focus their attention on prayer and the ministry of the word.


The Bible shows clearly that the church has a duty to care for those within the church family, with a priority on those closest to it. It must particularly care for those unable to care for themselves.

Help Us Help Others
-------------------

Do you want to be able to help members of the church family who are struggling at the moment? Here are a few ideas:

1. **Talk to people you know**, especially those in church who might be isolated, and ask how they are doing.  People can struggle with loneliness and worry at least as much as practical things, and your listening will help them open up.
2.	If you know someone who might need help with money, you can **refer them to the Deacons Fund** for a chat. The enquiry form is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jiLqyULkQUe5OOZzBogzKMnPr0uHgmR_wPoonsEOJ4M/edit).
3.	You can also **signpost people to sources of advice** and help. We’ve listed a few below; if you know others, great.
4.	If you have experience of living on a low income, or supporting people who are, and are interested in helping, let us know. We’re exploring recruiting peer supporters to get alongside people.
5.	**Don’t be a solo superhero!** Work with your church family. Please feel free to ask for help or advice. No human has all the answers, and we can all feel a little unsure at times. This is as true in charity and pastoral work – especially in a pandemic! – as anything.
