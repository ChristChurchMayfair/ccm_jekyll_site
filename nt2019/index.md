New Testament in a Year
=============================

In 2019 we're going to read the New Testament (and the Psalms, if you're up for it) together as a church family.

In order to help keep on schedule you can recieve a daily email, each morning, to reminder to read and keep you on track with the current passage.

Though emails are certainly no silver bullet in the endeavour to read the Bible in a disciplined way we do hope they are helpful. If you find they're not you can opt-out at any time using the link at the bottom of any of the emails and we'd love to hear your feedback on what really helps you spend time with God in his Word.

Enter your email address here and hit subscribe to get daily Bible reading reminders. This list is separate from other Christ Church Mayfair mailing lists and will only ever be used for emailing you Bible reading reminders and for nothing else.
