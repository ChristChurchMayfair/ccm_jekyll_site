New Testament in a Year
=============================

In 2019 we’re going to read the New Testament (and the Psalms, if you’re up for it) together as a church family. It is one chapter a day from Monday – Friday, and then you have the weekend to catch-up / do something else / read the Psalm that comes with the Saturday and Sunday emails.

How it works
------------
You receive a daily email each morning with that day’s chapter. There will also be a link to a Facebook group where you can discuss the reading with others at church (you could also form a WhatsApp group to discuss the readings with a smaller group).

Structure
---------
You can see the whole plan [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRy1UDiUKU6af_Qda2bAhkC_30V2FaPZoc_cr_oj4uc/edit?usp=sharing). Rather than going straight through we have split the four gospels through the year, and made some other tweaks, such as following Luke with Acts (which is after all, Luke vol.2)

We hope that the external prompt of receiving the reading each morning, and the encouragement of doing something with others will help us all to be strengthened in the daily discipline of prayerful Bible reading. If you find it doesn’t work for you, then you can opt-out at any time using the link at the bottom of any of the emails and we’d love to hear your feedback on what really helps you spend time with God in his Word.
