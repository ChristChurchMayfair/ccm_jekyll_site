The Bible is the main way we can hear God speak today.

Every Sunday we hear from the Bible and have it explained, working our way through books of the Bible, continually discovering God's word is as relevant as ever!

The best way to hear these talks is in person, but we record many of them so that you can get an idea of what we teach.

You can also keep up to date via talks our podcast feed or our sermons app, great for listening on your commute.
