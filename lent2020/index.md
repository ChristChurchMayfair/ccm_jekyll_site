Lent Daily Emails
=============================

The aim of these emails is to give us **40 things that the death of Jesus achieved**, so that we can meditate and feed on those truths as we go through Lent to Easter. Each day there will be a passage, some comments and then one of the Olney hymns written by William Cowper & John Newton (author of Amazing Grace). 

How to get involved
-------------------

Enter your email address here and hit subscribe to get daily Lent email delivered to you each morning. This list is separate from other Christ Church Mayfair mailing lists and will only ever be used for emailing you for Lent 2020 and for nothing else. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link at the bottom of the email.
