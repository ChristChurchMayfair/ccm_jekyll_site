Here are the service outlines and sheets and lyrics for songs for this coming Sunday's services. Please get in touch with your bandleader if you have any questions about these.

If you can't make it for any reason, please find someone to swap with you and then add the swap details to ChurchSuite. [Here's a video showing you how to do that!](https://youtu.be/A4_r-1_Aoi4)

Thank you for serving the church family with your musical skills!
