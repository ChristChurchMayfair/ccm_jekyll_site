        <h1 id="christ-church-mayfair-general-privacy-notice">Christ Church Mayfair General Privacy Notice</h1>

<h2 id="your-personal-data--what-is-it">Your personal data – what is it?</h2>

<p>“Personal data” is any information about a living individual which allows them to be identified from that data (for example a name, photographs, videos, email address, or address).  Identification can be by the information alone or in conjunction with any other information.  The processing of personal data is governed by the Data Protection Act 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and other legislation relating to personal data and rights such as the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h2>

<p>This Privacy Notice describes the way that we, Christ Church Mayfair (“CCM”), as a controller use your data.</p>

<p>The Church of England is made up of a number of different organisations and office-holders who work together to deliver the Church’s mission in each community.  The Church Council of CCM works together with:</p>

<p>the incumbent of the parish (that is, our Senior Minister);
the bishops of the Diocese of London; and
the London Diocesan Fund, which is responsible for the financial and administrative arrangements for the Diocese of London.
As the Church is made up of all of these persons and organisations working together, we may need to share personal data we hold with them so that they can carry out their responsibilities to the Church and our community such as the names and addresses on our electoral roll.</p>

<p>The legal entity governing our church is The Bible Talks Trust (charity number 1092036) but we are transitioning to Christ Church Mayfair Charitable Company (charity number 1152061) shortly. The legal entity is accountable for the finances of the church, our Safeguarding and other legal matters.</p>

<p>Each of the controllers has their own tasks within the Church of England and a description of what data is processed and for what purpose is set out in this Privacy Notice.  This Privacy Notice is sent to you by CCM on our own behalf and on behalf of each of the controllers listed above.  In the rest of this Privacy Notice, we use the word “we” to refer to each controller, as appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="what-data-do-the-controllers-listed-above-process">What data do the controllers listed above process?</h2>

<p>They will process some or all of the following where necessary to perform their tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Names, titles, and aliases, photographs;</li>
  <li>Contact details such as telephone numbers, addresses, and email addresses;</li>
  <li>Where they are relevant to our mission, or where you provide them to us, we may process demographic information such as gender, age, date of birth, marital status, nationality, education/work histories, academic/professional qualifications, hobbies, family composition, and dependants;</li>
  <li>Where you make donations or pay for activities such as weekends away, financial identifiers such as bank account numbers, payment card numbers, payment/transaction identifiers, policy numbers, and claim numbers;</li>
  <li>The data we process is likely to constitute special category data because, as a church, the fact that we process your data at all may be suggestive of your religious beliefs. Where you provide this information, we may also process other categories of special category data: racial or ethnic origin, sex life, mental and physical health, details of injuries, medication/treatment received, political beliefs, labour union affiliation, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning sexual orientation and criminal records, fines and other similar judicial records.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-we-process-your-personal-data">How do we process your personal data?</h2>

<p>The controllers will comply with their legal obligations to keep personal data up to date; to store and destroy it securely; to not collect or retain excessive amounts of personal data; to keep personal data secure, and to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access and disclosure and to ensure that appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to protect personal data.</p>

<p>We use your personal data for some or all of the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To enable us to meet all legal and statutory obligations (which include maintaining and publishing our electoral roll in accordance with the Church Representation Rules);</li>
  <li>To carry out comprehensive Safeguarding procedures (including due diligence and complaints handling) in accordance with best safeguarding practice from time to time with the aim of ensuring that all children and adults-at-risk are provided with safe environments;</li>
  <li>To minister to you and provide you with pastoral and spiritual care (such as visiting you when you are gravely ill or bereaved) and to organise and perform ecclesiastical services for you, such as baptisms, weddings and funerals;</li>
  <li>To deliver the Church’s mission to our community, and to carry out any other voluntary or charitable activities for the benefit of the public as provided for in the constitution and statutory framework of each controller;</li>
  <li>To administer the parish, deanery, archdeaconry and diocesan membership records;</li>
  <li>To fundraise and promote the interests of the Church and CCM;</li>
  <li>To maintain our own accounts and records;</li>
  <li>To process a donation that you have made (including Gift Aid information);</li>
  <li>To seek your views or comments;</li>
  <li>To notify you of changes to our services, events and role holders;</li>
  <li>To send you communications which you have requested (such as Timeout) and that may be of interest to you. These may include information about campaigns, events, appeals, other fundraising activities;</li>
  <li>To process a grant or application for a role; and</li>
  <li>To enable us to provide a voluntary service for the benefit of the public in a particular geographical area as specified in our constitution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-legal-basis-for-processing-your-personal-data">What is the legal basis for processing your personal data?</h2>

<p>Most of our data is processed because it is necessary for our legitimate interests, or the legitimate interests of a third party (such as another organisation in the Church of England).  An example of this would be our Safeguarding work to protect children and adults at risk.  We will always take into account your interests, rights and freedoms.</p>

<p>Some of our processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.  For example, we are required by the Church Representation Rules to administer and publish the electoral roll.</p>

<p>We may also process personal data if it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or to take steps to enter into a contract.  An example of this would be processing your personal data in connection with the hire of church facilities.</p>

<p>Religious organisations are also permitted to process information about your religious beliefs to administer membership or contact details.</p>

<p>Where your information is used other than in accordance with one of these legal bases, we will usually obtain your consent to that use unless there Is another substantial public interest that we can rely on to use your personal data.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-your-personal-data">Sharing your personal data</h2>

<p>Your personal data will be treated as strictly confidential.  It will only be shared with third parties where it is necessary for the performance of our tasks where we are legally required to share your personal data, where we share your personal data to protect CCM or another individual, or where you first give us your prior consent.  It is likely that we will need to share your personal data with some or all of the following (but only where necessary):</p>

<p>The appropriate bodies of the Church of England including the other data controllers;
Our agents, servants and contractors. For example, we may ask a commercial provider to maintain our database software e.g. ChurchSuite;
Other clergy or lay persons nominated or licensed by the bishops of the Diocese of London to support the mission of the Church in our parish. For example, our clergy are supported by our area dean and archdeacon, who may provide confidential mentoring and pastoral support.  Assistant or temporary ministers, including curates, deacons, licensed lay ministers, commissioned lay ministers or persons with Bishop’s Permissions may participate in our mission in support of our regular clergy;
Other persons or organisations operating within the Diocese of London including, where relevant, the London Diocesan Board for Schools and Subsidiary Bodies
On occasion, other churches with which we are carrying out joint events or activities.</p>

<h2 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-personal-data">How long do we keep your personal data?</h2>

<p>We will retain some records according to certain regulatory and statutory responsibilities.  We may keep some other records for an extended period of time. For example, it is current best practice to keep financial records for a minimum period of 7 years after the date of the transaction to support HMRC audits.  In general, we will endeavour to keep personal data only for as long as we need it.  This means that we may delete it when it is no longer needed.</p>
