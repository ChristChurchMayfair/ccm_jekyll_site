We believe that following Jesus defines the way we live life. We therefore gather in a number midweek groups. We meet either in the church building or in peopleâ€™s homes across the city, to encourage each other to live for Jesus through the week. 

If you work in the area, join us at  to Midweek in Mayfair, a lunchtime meeting on Tuesdays. Our aim is to explain the good news about Jesus Christ, to connect our faith with our work and to encourage one another as we do this.
