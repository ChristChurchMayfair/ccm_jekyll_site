We believe that following Jesus defines the way we live life.

It’s really important to us to meet together during the week, either in the church building or in people’s homes, to go deeper into God’s word and encourage each other to live for Jesus in every area of life.

If you work in and around W1, do join us at Midweek in Mayfair, a lunchtime meeting on Tuesdays. We want to explain the good news about Jesus Christ, to connect our faith with our work and to encourage one another as we do this.
