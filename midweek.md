We believe that following Jesus defines the way we live life.

It’s really important to us to meet together during the week, to go deeper into God’s word and encourage each other to live for Jesus in every area of life. Many of our church family work centrally so it makes sense for some to meet in the church building. Others host small groups in homes around London.

If you work in and around W1, do join us at Midweek in Mayfair, a lunchtime meeting on Tuesdays. We want to explain the good news about Jesus Christ, to connect our faith with our work and to encourage one another as we do this.
